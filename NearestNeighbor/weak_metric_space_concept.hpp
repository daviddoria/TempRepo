/**
 * \file weak_metric_space_concept.hpp
 * 
 * This library defines the traits and concepts that pertain to what can be considered 
 * a metric-space, as used in ReaK::pp. Metric-spaces are based on the Topology concept 
 * from the Boost.Graph library, but with additional requirements which are needed 
 * in algorithms tailored for a metric-space (see metric_space_search.hpp). Basically,
 * the concept of a metric-space in ReaK::pp corresponds to the mathematical concept of 
 * a metric-space (see wikipedia or any decent math book).

 * pd = space.difference(p1,p2);  The difference (pd) between two points (p1,p2) can be obtained.

 * p1 = space.move_position_toward(p1,d,p2);  A point can be obtained by moving a fraction (d) away from one point (p1) to another (p2).
 * 
 * p1 = space.origin();  The origin of the space can be obtained.
 * 
 * p1 = space.adjust(p1,d * pd + pd - pd);  A point-difference can be scaled (d * pd), added / subtracted to another point-difference and added to a point (p1) to obtain an adjusted point.
 * 
 * pd = -pd;  A point-difference can be negated (reversed) and is assignable.
 *
 * pd -= pd;  A point-difference can be subtracted-and-assigned.
